ACEP Guidelines
=

*For the treatment of back pain, given a lack of demonstrated evidence of superior efficacy of either opioid or nonopioid analgesics, and the individual and community risks associated with opioid use, misuse, and abuse, opioids should be reserved for more severe pain or pain refractory to other analgesics rather than routinely prescribed.


***Emergency providers should avoid the routine prescribing of outpatient opioids for a patient with an acute exacerbation of chronic noncancer pain seen in the ED.**

**‡The administration of IV and IM opioids in the ED for the relief of acute exacerbations of chronic pain is discouraged.**

**‡If the emergency medical provider decides to prescribe opioids to a patient with chronic pain, the provider should only prescribe enough pills to last until the office of the patient’s primary opioid prescriber opens.**

†If opioids are indicated, the prescription should be for the lowest practical dose for a limited duration (e.g., 3 days), and the prescriber should consider the patient’s risk for opioid misuse, abuse, or diversion.

*The clinician should, if practicable, honor existing patient–physician pain contracts/treatment agreements.

*The clinician should, if practicable, consider past prescription patterns from information sources such as prescription drug monitoring programs.

‡Emergency medical providers should not provide replacement prescriptions for controlled substances that were lost, destroyed, or stolen.

‡Long-acting or controlled-release opioids (such as OxyContin®, fentanyl patches, and methadone) should not be prescribed from the ED.

‡Prescriptions for controlled substances from the ED should state that the patient is required to provide a government-issued picture identification (ID) to the pharmacy filling the prescription.

‡Emergency medical providers should not provide replacement doses of methadone for patients in a methadone treatment program.
