|DRUG|DOSAGE|
|--|--|
|IV Toradol| 15-30mg Q6H (15mg if >65yo)|
|IV Dilaudid| start w/ 1mg |

Morphine
- check pain level after 30mins 
- beware in kidney pts. morphine not cleared as quickly and can accumulate and become supratherapeutic

Hydromorphone isn’t great for renal pts bc it is dialyzable. Reduce dose to like 25% if using hydromorphone.  

Fentanyl is better for renal pts b/c it’s not dialyzable and reduced clearance makes fentanyl last longer which is nice. Still reduce fentanyl dose to about 25-50% of standard dosing. 

Oral - hydrocodone metabolizes to hydromorphone, so oxycodone is preferred. For either drug, reduce dose by 50-75% in renal patients to start. 

Buprenorphine is another oral outpt option very safe in renal failure. Sublingual would be dosed 0.1-0.2mg/kg
